# Meridian Architecture — Constitutional Operating System for Autonomous Institutions

## What Meridian Is

Meridian is a constitutional operating system for running AI agents as managed, governed digital labor. It is built on exactly six primitives: **Institution, Agent, Authority, Treasury, Court, Commitment**.

Organizations use Meridian to:
- Found charter-governed institutions with lifecycle management
- Register and govern AI agents as first-class entities
- Enforce authority through approval queues, delegations, and kill switch
- Track real money through treasury with reserve floors and runway
- Adjudicate violations through a court system with sanctions and appeals
- Run agent workflows with identity, permissions, budget, and audit
- Meter usage and manage spend per organization and per agent

## What Meridian Is Not

- Not a chatbot or assistant product
- Not a PMM/CI tool (competitive intelligence is the first *managed vertical*, not the company)
- Not an open marketplace (ecosystem comes after trust primitives exist)
- Not an uncontrolled autonomy platform

## Composition Pattern

The six primitives **compose over** the existing economy layer — they import and extend, never rewrite.

| Economy Module | Platform Primitive | What's Composed |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `economy/authority.py` | `meridian_platform/authority.py` | `check_rights()`, `get_sprint_lead()`, `BLOCK_MATRIX` |
| `economy/sanctions.py` | `meridian_platform/court.py` | `apply_sanction()`, `lift_sanction()`, `check_auto_sanctions()`, `get_restrictions()` |
| `economy/revenue.py` | `meridian_platform/treasury.py` | `load_revenue()`, `load_ledger()` |
| `economy/ledger.json` | `meridian_platform/treasury.py`, `agent_registry.py` | Treasury section, agent scores |
| `meridian_platform/metering.py` | `meridian_platform/treasury.py` | `get_spend()`, `budget_check()` |
| `meridian_platform/audit.py` | All primitives | `log_event()` |

## Data Model

### Institution (organizations.py)
```
Institution {
  id: string
  name: string
  slug: string
  owner_id: string
  members: Member[]
  plan: string
  status: string
  charter: string                    # Founding purpose / constitutional text
  policy_defaults: {                 # Default policies for agents
    max_budget_per_agent_usd: float
    require_approval_above_usd: float
    auto_sanctions_enabled: bool
    auth_decay_per_epoch: int
  }
  treasury_id: string               # Current treasury pointer until treasury registry cutover
  lifecycle_state: founding|active|suspended|dissolved
  settings: object
}
```

### Agent (agent_registry.py)
```
Agent {
  id: string
  org_id: string
  name: string
  purpose: string
  role: string
  model_policy: object
  scopes: string[]
  budget: object
  approval_required: bool
  rollout_state: string
  sla: object
  reputation_units: int
  authority_units: int
  sponsor_id: string                 # Who sponsored creation
  risk_state: nominal|elevated|critical|suspended
  lifecycle_state: provisioned|active|quarantined|decommissioned
  economy_key: string                # Key in economy/ledger.json
  incident_count: int                # Running count of court incidents
  escalation_path: string[]          # Ordered escalation chain
}
```

### Authority (authority.py)
```
AuthorityQueue {
  pending_approvals: { id: Approval }
  delegations: { id: Delegation }
  kill_switch: { engaged, engaged_by, engaged_at, reason }
}

Approval { id, requester_agent_id, action, resource, cost_usd, status, decided_by }
Delegation { id, from_agent_id, to_agent_id, scopes, expires_at }
```

### Treasury (treasury.py)
Read facade — no state file. Reads from:
- `economy/ledger.json` (balance, revenue, capital)
- `economy/revenue.json` (orders, receivables)
- `meridian_platform/metering.jsonl` (spend)

On the live host today, treasury resolves through founding-institution capsule
aliases backed by the live ledger and revenue state. Authority and court state
have already moved behind the founding institution capsule boundary.
The founding treasury surface now also carries a payout proposal lifecycle:
proposal records are capsule-backed, execution is warrant-bound through
`action_class = payout_execution`, and successful execution writes back into
the same founding ledger + transaction journal. That does **not** mean live
contributor payouts are active; execution remains phase- and reserve-gated.
The same treasury surface now also validates a founding settlement adapter
contract. The live host exposes that registry through
`GET /api/treasury/settlement-adapters`, but only `internal_ledger` is
execution-enabled today. Founding-only service state now follows the same
canonical rule: subscriptions, the owner ledger, and payment-monitor daemon
state all resolve through founding capsule aliases rather than standalone
singleton files. For subscriptions specifically, the founding capsule file is
now canonical and the old `company/subscriptions*.json` paths are
compatibility links back to that capsule state.
The live workspace now also exposes `GET /api/treasury/accounts` and
`GET /api/treasury/funding-sources`, both backed by founding capsule protocol
files. `treasury_accounts.json` is synced from the founding ledger and payout
state, while `funding_sources.json` records owner-capital and future funding
events as explicit treasury inputs rather than implicit ledger deltas.
The federation boundary now also exposes `GET /api/federation/execution-jobs`
as a receiver-side local-review surface for incoming `execution_request`
envelopes. Those jobs are capsule-backed and local to the bound institution;
they do not imply that live federation itself is enabled.
The same mirror now also carries the witness archive shape:
`GET /api/federation/witness/archive` and
`POST /api/federation/witness/archive` exist so the runtime can describe the
witness-host contract honestly, but on this host they remain disabled and
fail-closed because the live deployment is not a witness host.
The OSS parity route `POST /api/federation/execution-jobs/execute` exists in
the live workspace, but it fails closed without changing state because those
receiver-side jobs stay review-only while federation remains disabled on this
host.
Local warrant review now also drives that queue honestly: approving the
receiver-side warrant moves the job to `ready`, while staying or revoking it
changes the job to `blocked` or `rejected` without pretending live
cross-host execution is active.
The same mirrored review loop now also carries the OSS `court_notice`
contract: receiver-side warrant review can prepare a signed review notice back
to the source host so sender-side warrant state and linked commitment
provenance can reflect remote review before settlement. Because this live host
still disables federation at runtime, that path remains fail-closed here.
For parity, the live workspace also declares `POST /api/federation/execution-jobs/execute`,
but that route fails closed with no state change. It exists so the public
boundary stays explicit: live jobs are still review-only objects while
federation remains disabled on the host.
`POST /api/treasury/settlement-adapters/preflight` now exposes the same
contract as a non-executing validation surface, so live can say honestly
whether an adapter is merely registered, whether this host supports it, and
whether the supplied proof shape would be acceptable before execution.
The live workspace now also exposes owner-gated accounting mutations through
`POST /api/accounting/expense|reimburse|draw`. Those routes call tracked
accounting service helpers directly, so the founding capsule owner ledger and
treasury journal stay canonical even when the operator uses the workspace
instead of the CLI, and the writer now takes an explicit bound `org_id` all
the way down to the capsule-backed owner ledger instead of relying on a hidden
founding default. This is an institution-owned service running on a
founding-locked deployment, not multi-institution live accounting.
The live workspace now also exposes admin-gated subscription mutations through
`POST /api/subscriptions/add|convert|verify-payment|remove|set-email|record-delivery`.
Those routes call tracked subscription helpers directly, so the founding
capsule entitlement store stays canonical even when the operator uses the
workspace instead of the CLI. This is the same institution-owned service shape
on a founding-locked deployment, not a public multi-institution subscription
surface.

### Court (court.py)
```
CourtRecords {
  violations: { id: Violation }
  appeals: { id: Appeal }
}

Violation { id, agent_id, org_id, type, severity(1-6), evidence, policy_ref, sanction_applied, status }
Appeal { id, violation_id, agent_id, grounds, status, decided_by }
```

Severity-to-sanction mapping (CLAUDE.md §9):
- 1-2: No sanction (light failure)
- 3: probation (rejected output)
- 4: lead_ban (rework creation)
- 5: zero_authority (false confidence)
- 6: remediation_only (critical failure)

### Warrants (warrants.py)
```
Warrant {
  warrant_id: string
  institution_id: string
  boundary_name: string
  action_class: routine_internal|budget_spend|payout_execution|cross_institution_commitment|sanction_execution|federated_execution
  risk_class: low|moderate|high|critical
  actor_id: string
  session_id: string
  request_hash: string
  court_review_state: auto_issued|pending_review|approved|stayed|revoked
  execution_state: ready|executed
  expires_at: timestamp
  execution_refs: object
}
```

Today the live warrant surface is still founding-org-only, but it is already a
first-class capsule-backed record instead of an ad hoc field on delivery
payloads.

### Commitments (commitments.py)
```
Commitment {
  commitment_id: string
  institution_id: string
  target_host_id: string
  target_institution_id: string
  summary: string
  note: string
  status: proposed|accepted|rejected|breached|settled
  proposed_by: string
  accepted_by: string
  rejected_by: string
  breached_by: string
  settled_by: string
  delivery_refs: object[]
}
```

The live commitment surface is founding-only and capsule-backed. When a
`commitment_id` is supplied to federation send, it must resolve to the target
host and institution before delivery, and successful sends append a local
sender-side delivery reference back to the commitment record. Live federation
is still disabled on the host today, so this is not yet cross-host execution
proof. Incoming `settlement_notice` envelopes mirror the live treasury
settlement-adapter preflight contract before any local settlement record is
written, so the receiver side still fails closed on unsupported or invalid
adapter evidence.
The same live mirror now also declares warrant-bound `commitment_proposal`,
`commitment_acceptance`, and `commitment_breach_notice` message types in the
boundary registry and routes them through the same commitment-specific
validators as OSS. That is contract parity only: the host still fails closed
instead of claiming active multi-institution commitment delivery.

### Cases (cases.py)
```
Case {
  case_id: string
  institution_id: string
  target_host_id: string
  target_institution_id: string
  claim_type: non_delivery|fraudulent_proof|breach_of_commitment|invalid_settlement_notice|misrouted_execution
  linked_commitment_id: string
  linked_warrant_id: string
  status: open|stayed|resolved
  opened_by: string
  reviewed_by: string
}
```

The live case surface is founding-only and capsule-backed. Commitment breach
can auto-open a linked local case record, but live federation remains
disabled, so these are local court-network records rather than live cross-host
dispute execution proof. Blocking commitment IDs / peer host IDs are surfaced
for runtime truth, while any peer-suspension path stays fail-closed until live
federation is actually enabled. Contradictory delivery proofs can still be
classified into local case records, and a linked execution warrant can be
stayed locally. The same active case state now blocks commitment settlement,
and the live workspace now mirrors the OSS `case_notice` send/receive contract
for `/api/cases/open|stay|resolve`, while still failing closed whenever
federation dispatch or peer control-plane sync is attempted on the
founding-only host. All of this remains a founding-workspace mirror until live
federation is truly enabled.

### Payout Proposals (treasury.py)
```
PayoutProposal {
  proposal_id: string
  contributor_id: string
  amount_usd: number
  recipient_wallet_id: string
  status: draft|submitted|under_review|approved|dispute_window|executed|rejected|cancelled
  warrant_id: string
  settlement_adapter: string
  execution_refs: object
}
```

This surface is founding-only on the live host. Workspace APIs can propose,
submit, review, approve, reject, cancel, open the dispute window, and execute
against the founding ledger. Execution requires:
- a payout-eligible wallet
- surplus above reserve
- phase-5 contributor-payout eligibility
- an executable `payout_execution` warrant
- a settlement adapter that is registered and execution-enabled for the
  founding host

Execution writes normalized `execution_refs` containing the adapter proof type,
verification/finality states, and the proof payload or journal reference used
to justify settlement.

`meridian_platform/court_records.json` are now migration inputs for the founding
institution, not the live source of truth.

## Workflow Verticals

### Competitive Intelligence (current proving vertical)
- Cited intelligence workflow for AI/product teams
- Watchlist-driven research, writing, QA, and scoring
- Battlecard-style snapshots and research-on-demand outputs
- Delivery promise currently narrowed to founder-led manual pilot
- Workflow shape: research -> extract -> write -> QA -> deliver -> score -> court-review

### Research-on-Demand (live, via MCP)
- Topic-driven research with sourced findings
- Delegated to Atlas agent

## Current State (2026-03-21)

### What works:
- Six constitutional primitives (Institution, Agent, Authority, Treasury, Court, Commitment)
- Healthy runtime on the live host
- Governed CI workflow logic and reference pipeline
- MCP server with 5 paid tools + x402 payment gating for the founding Meridian service
- 3-ledger economy (REP/AUTH/CASH) with auto-scoring
- Court auto-review wired into scoring pipeline
- Authority checks wired into MCP tool calls
- Treasury budget enforcement on paid operations
- Public web surface (landing, demo, pilot, support pages)
- Founder-led manual pilot path
- Support path separated from customer revenue in doctrine and public surfaces
- Founding-org authority and court state moved behind capsule-backed paths
- Founding-org warrant state exposed through `/api/warrants` and reflected in `/api/status`
- Founding-org commitment state exposed through `/api/commitments` and reflected in `/api/status`
- Live boundary registry now surfaces warrant requirements for `federation_gateway`
- Sender-side federated `execution_request` delivery path now requires an executable warrant in code, even though live federation remains disabled

### What is intentionally not claimed as live:
- Automated subscriber delivery for external customers
- Broad self-serve trial or paid subscription flow
- Institution-scoped subscription storage or MCP session routing
- Telegram bot/channel as the honest default customer path
- Multi-institution isolation with zero founding-org shared state in the live system
- Active cross-host federation execution on the live host
- Treasury registries fully cut over from founding ledger pointers into capsule-owned state

The owner-facing workspace API is process-bound to the founding Meridian
institution. `/api/context` reports that bound context, and request-level
`org_id` or `X-Meridian-Org-Id` hints are only accepted on exact match. This is
an explicit single-org boundary, not live multi-institution routing. When
workspace credentials carry an explicit `org_id` scope, startup rejects any
mismatch with the founding Meridian institution. If credentials also carry a
`user_id`, workspace mutations resolve the actor through the founding org
membership and enforce role-based mutation guards on top of Basic auth.
`/api/context` now returns the effective mutation permission snapshot for that
bound actor. `/api/context` and `/api/status` now also surface `runtime_core`,
which exposes:
- the bound institution context
- the serving host identity
- the current boundary identity model
- the live boundary registry (`workspace`, `federation_gateway`, `mcp_service`, `payment_monitor`, `subscriptions`, `accounting`, `cli`)
- the live admission model
- the live federation-gateway state

The owner workspace also now exposes read-only snapshots for two
institution-owned service boundaries on the founding-locked host:
`GET /api/subscriptions` and `GET /api/accounting`. Those surfaces read
directly from capsule-canonical state and explicitly surface both canonical and
legacy compatibility paths. Accounting now exposes owner-gated workspace
mutations, and subscriptions expose admin-gated workspace mutations. Both
boundaries remain founding-locked and do not claim self-serve
multi-institution routing.

That admission model is explicitly `single_institution_deployment`. The live
workspace is institution-bound, but this deployment does not admit additional
institutions beyond the founding Meridian org. The live federation gateway is
also explicit now: the boundary exists in surfaced state, but this deployment
keeps it disabled until a real peer transport, signing secret, and trusted
peer registry are configured.
The same boundary now also surfaces a founding capsule-backed federation inbox
read model. Live still does not claim active federation execution, but if the
gateway ever accepts a message, the receiver-side state no longer exists only
in audit lines.
`/api/admission` now exposes that founding-only admission state directly, and
the matching `POST /api/admission/admit|suspend|revoke` routes fail closed with
an explicit `founding_locked` rejection instead of implying shared admission.

### Hard numbers:
- Treasury: $2.00 (owner capital, not customer revenue)
- Customer revenue: $0.00
- External paying customers: 0
- Deliverable targets today: 0
- Internal test targets today: 2
- Latest brief available for delivery: none

## Principles

1. Five primitives govern everything — Institution, Agent, Authority, Treasury, Court
2. Compose over economy — import and extend, never rewrite
3. Every action is auditable — who did what, when, with what authority
4. Institutions should own their own resources; remaining founding-org shared state is technical debt, not doctrine
5. Metering is core product, not internal tooling
6. Trust before marketplace — control primitives before ecosystem
7. Revenue before tokenization — prove the money path first
8. Public surface must be truthful — no claim outruns repo reality
