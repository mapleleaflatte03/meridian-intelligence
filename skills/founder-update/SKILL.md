# Founder Update

Use this skill when the user gives a short prompt such as:
- founder update

## Workflow

1. Expand the short request into a concrete Meridian task using session continuity and live host facts.
2. Route the work through these preferred specialists: QUILL, AEGIS.
3. Keep outputs bounded, operator-usable, and grounded in verified Meridian state.
4. Return only confirmed facts, explicit unknowns, and the next operational move.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent missing facts, timelines, or citations.
- Prefer live Meridian host facts over generic web knowledge.
- Escalate uncertainty instead of pretending the request is fully specified.

## Why Created

- Created automatically because a short request exposed a missing reusable playbook.
- Session: web_api:org_48b05c21
